Machine learning disease prediction is a system that predicts diseases based on information 
provided by users. It predicts the disease of the patient or the user based on the information or the 
symptoms enter into the web system and gives results based on that information. If the patient isn't 
much serious and therefore the user just wants to understand the sort of disease, he/she has been 
through. It's a system which gives the ideas and tips to take care of the health of the user and it 
provides how to seek out disease using this prediction. so just by entering the symptoms and every 
one other useful information the user can get to understand the disease he/she is affected by and 
therefore the health industry also can get enjoy this technique by just asking the symptoms from the 
user and entering within the system and in only few seconds they will tell the precise and up to some 
extent the accurate diseases. These kind of ML systems has been implemented by many other 
organizations, but we intend to make it unique and more useful to users who use this system. This 
Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning is completely done with the help of Machine 
Learning algorithms and Python Programming language with Flask Interface for it and also using the 
dataset that's available previously by the hospitals using that we'll predict the disease. Nowadayâ€™s 
doctors are using many technologies and methodology for not only can identify and diagnose 
common diseases, but also many deadly diseases.



The exact and accurate analysis is normally attributed to the successful treatment. When 
doctors fail to make accurate decisions while examining a patient's disease, disease forecasting 
systems that use ML algorithms can help. The project disease prediction using machine learning is 
being developed to beat general disease in earlier stages, as we all know in a competitive environment 
of economic development, mankind has been involved in so much that he/she isn't concerned about. 
According to research, 40% of people ignore general disease, which leads to harmful disease later. 
The most common cause of ignorance is a lack of motivation to consult a doctor. In terms of time, 
people have become so engrossed in their activities that they have no time to convene a meeting or 
consult a doctor, resulting in a fatal disease. According to research, 70 percent of people in India 
suffer from general disease, and 25 percent die as a result of early ignorance. The main reason for 
developing this project is so that a user can sit at their convenience and have a health check-up. The 
UI is designed in such a way that anyone can easily operate it and have a check-up
